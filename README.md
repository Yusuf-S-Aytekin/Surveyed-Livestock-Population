# Surveyed Livestock Population

- I created this graph for Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course offered by Michigan on Coursera.

### Data Source

- The data are taken from Eurostat's database of agriculture (agr).
- The link is available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/agriculture/data/database?node_code=apro_mt_ls)
- Explanatory text of the database is [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/apro_anip_esms.htm#unit_measure1681892396594)

### Research Question

- How has Europe's livestock population (Bovine, goats, sheep, and pigs) changed since 1969?

### Cleaning Process

- The values that are not available (indicated by ':') are dropped to 0 to calculate the surveyed livestock population.
- The livestock population of each country was summed, and the total population of the livestock animals in Europe was determined.

### About The Image

- The visualization shows how Europe's livestock population (Bovine, goats, sheep, and pigs) has changed since 1969.
